# Generic, a code generation tool to enable generics in go.

`go install github.com/taylorchu/generic/cmd/generic`

This is an experiment to enable generics with code generation in the most elegant way.

## Example

You can create a package like this. Note that `Type` and `TypeQueue` are type placeholders.

```go
package queue

type Type string

// TypeQueue represents a queue of Type types.
type TypeQueue struct {
	items []Type
}

// New makes a new empty Type queue.
func New() *TypeQueue {
	return &TypeQueue{items: make([]Type, 0)}
}

// Enq adds an item to the queue.
func (q *TypeQueue) Enq(obj Type) *TypeQueue {
	q.items = append(q.items, obj)
	return q
}

// Deq removes and returns the next item in the queue.
func (q *TypeQueue) Deq() Type {
	obj := q.items[0]
	q.items = q.items[1:]
	return obj
}

// Len gets the current number of Type items in the queue.
func (q *TypeQueue) Len() int {
	return len(q.items)
}
```

This is what a rewrite rule looks like:

```
result Type->int64 TypeQueue->FIFO
```

It says that the __package target__ is `result`, and what each type replaces to.

Put this line in one of your `.go` file.

```go
//go:generate generic github.com/YourName/queue result Type->int64 TypeQueue->FIFO
```

The output is saved to `$PWD/result/` after you run `go generate`.

```go
package result

type FIFO struct {
	items []int64
}

func New() *FIFO {
	return &FIFO{items: make([]int64, 0)}
}

func (q *FIFO) Enq(obj int64) *FIFO {
	q.items = append(q.items, obj)
	return q
}

func (q *FIFO) Deq() int64 {
	obj := q.items[0]
	q.items = q.items[1:]
	return obj
}

func (q *FIFO) Len() int {
	return len(q.items)
}
```

If the type is not a built-in type, for example, `list.Element`, you write rules like this:

`Type->container/list:list.Element`

If the type is from the current package, add a dot `.` to to the beginning of the package target, for example. `.result`.

You can find more examples in `fixture/` and their outputs in `output/`.

## Best practices

### Decide a good package target name

Package target is essentially go package path, and the base name of this package path is a package name.

> Good package names are short and clear. They are lower case, with no under_scores or mixedCaps.

See [Package names](https://blog.golang.org/package-names).

### Replace TypeXXX with types defined in the _current_ package

The package target should start with `.`. For example, `.queue`. The tool will output in the current package (instead of creating a new sub-package) to prevent circular imports. The package name is set from `go generate`.

### Replace TypeXXX with _built-in_ types, or types defined in _another_ package

The package target should start with `internal/`. For example, `internal/queue`.

> When the go command sees an import of a package with internal in its path, it verifies that the package doing the import is within the tree rooted at the parent of the internal directory. For example, a package .../a/b/c/internal/d/e/f can be imported only by code in the directory tree rooted at .../a/b/c. It cannot be imported by code in .../a/b/g or in any other repository.

See [Internal packages](https://golang.org/doc/go1.4#internalpackages).

## Existing approaches to generics in go

  - code generation
    - output
      - file
      - package (*)
    - rewrite method
      - simple string replacement
      - ast-based replacement (*)
    - type placeholder
      - text/template, i.e. `{{ .Type }}`
      - special types from a package, i.e. `generic.Type`
      - in-package type declaration, i.e. `type A int`
        - above-declaration comment, i.e. `// template type Vector(A, N)`
        - without comment
          - any type name
          - type name with certain pattern (*)
  - language change
  - interface{}
  - reflect
  - marshal everything to bytes/string
  - copy&paste

## What does `generic` do?

![](http://i.imgur.com/X07XInF.png)

`generic` does the followings if you put the following comments in your go code:

```go
// generate from a generic package and save result as a new package,
// with a list of rewrite rules!

//go:generate generic github.com/go/sort int Type->int
```

1. Run `go get -u github.com/go/sort` if the package does not exist locally.
  - If the package exists locally, go-get will not be called.
2. Gather `.go` files (skip `_test.go`) in github.com/go/sort
3. Apply AST rewrite to replace Type in those `.go` files to `int`.
  - Only type that starts with __Type__ and is [non-composite](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types) can be converted. This enables variable naming like __TypeKey__ or __TypeValue__
  that closely expresses meaning while there is still a namespace for type placeholder.
  - Many rewrite rules are possible: `TypeKey->string TypeValue->int`.
  - We can rewrite non-builtin types with `:`: `Type->github.com/go/types:types.Box`.
  - If a type placeholder has methods defined, the replaced type will need to implement those methods.
4. Type-check results.
5. Save the results as a new package called `int` in `$PWD`.
  - If there is already a dir called `int`, it will first be removed.
  - If the new package starts with `.`, it will save the results in `$PWD`:
      - The package name is set to `$GOPACKAGE` from `go generate`.
      - All top-level identifiers will have prefixes to prevent conflicts, and their uses will also be updated.
      - Filenames will be renamed to prevent conflicts.

## FAQ

### Why are type-checking and ast-based replacement important?

Type-checking and ast-based replacement ensure that the tool doesn't generate invalid code even you or the tool make mistakes, and rewrites identifiers in cases that it shouldn't.

### Why is type placeholder designed this way?

`type TypeXXX int32`

 - It provides a namespace for replaceable types.
 - Knowing that this type might be replaced, package creator can still write go-testable code with a concrete type.
 - It can express meaning. For example, `TypeQueue` shows that it is a queue.

### Why does this tool rewrite at package-level instead of file-level?

 - This tool tries NOT to apply any restriction for package creator except that any TypeXXX might be rewritten. Package creator has full flexibility to write normal go code.
 - It is common to distribute go code at package-level.
